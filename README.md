# ArduMower electric garage door

This repository contains resources for my electric garage door for ArduMower. I created them because cats and other animals went to the garage and left the products of their digestive tract in it :)

Used motor is UXCELL 30RPM 24V motor (https://www.ebay.com/itm/DC-24V-7000RPM-14RPM-8mmx14mm-Shaft-Electric-Power-Turbo-Worm-Geared-Motor-/232327516657). Schematic also consists from 24V relay and two microswitches.

Pad between two 100n capacitors is connected directly to the chassis of motor to avoid interference. PCB is mounted on motor with four M4 screws.

Extra space (top/left) around motor is used for mounting micro-switches at desired position.
