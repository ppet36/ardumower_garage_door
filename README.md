# ArduMower electric garage door

This repository contains resources for my electric garage door for ArduMower. I created them because cats and other animals went to the garage and left the products of their digestive tract in it :)

Used motor is UXCELL 30RPM 24V motor (https://www.ebay.com/itm/DC-24V-30RPM-8mmx15mm-Dual-D-Shape-Shaft-Electric-Power-Turbo-Worm-Geared-Motor/362278845277).

Pad between two 100n capacitors is connected directly to the chassis of motor to avoid interference. PCB is mounted on motor with four M4 screws.

Extra space (top/left) around motor is used for mounting micro-switches at desired position.
